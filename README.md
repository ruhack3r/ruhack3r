# Who I am
Hello there✌️  <br>
I'm Igor, a DevOps engineer with 4+ years of experience in companies in different industries (fintech, development, entertainment, consulting).

Currently I work as a DevSecOps engineer implementing DevSecOps processes from scratch. Also, I actively take part in Internal Developers Platform (IDP, aka Private Cloud) building.

I have experience being as the only engineer in project/company and as a team lead of a small team (up to 5 engineers).

Mostly I have worked with on-prem infrastructure but also I have experience with AWS infra built from scratch by myself.

Feel free to contact me. I'm opened to job opportunities as a DevOps/DevSecOps engineer or Platform engineer.
